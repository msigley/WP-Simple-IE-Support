# WP-Simple-IE-Support
Adds compatibility code layer for IE visitors. Provides a banner prompting them to download Edge.

## Banner
A banner prompting visitors using IE and non-chromium versions of Edge can be added to your sites using the `[is_ie_banner]` shortcode or the `is_ie_banner()` template tag.

The banner says the following:
> Looks like you're using an outdated web browser.<br />
> This website will no longer support outdated versions of Internet Explorer and Edge.<br />
> Click here to download and install the latest version of Microsoft Edge to use all of the features of this website.
