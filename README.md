Adds compatibility code layer for IE visitors. Provides a banner prompting them to download Edge.

## Banner
A banner prompting visitors using IE and non-chromium versions of Edge can be added to your sites using the `[is_ie_banner]` shortcode or the `is_ie_banner()` template tag.

The banner says the following:
```
Looks like you're using an outdated web browser.
This website will no longer support outdated versions of Internet Explorer and Edge.
Click here to download and install the latest version of Microsoft Edge to use all of the features of this website.
